    "content": "Instagram advertising can be incredibly powerful for beauty salons, but only if you avoid these critical mistakes that most businesses make...\n\n## 1. Using Generic Stock Photos\n\nYour potential clients want to see real results from real people. Generic stock photos of models don't build trust or showcase your actual work. Instead, use before/after photos of your clients (with permission) and authentic shots of your salon.\n\n## 2. Weak Call-to-Actions\n\nSaying 'DM us for more info' isn't compelling enough. Be specific: 'Book your free consultation this week' or 'Call now to claim your 20% new client discount.'\n\n## 3. Wrong Audience Targeting\n\nDon't just target 'women aged 25-45 interested in beauty.' Get specific: target people who live within 10 miles of your salon, have visited competitor pages, or show interest in specific treatments you offer.\n\n## 4. Ignoring Your Existing Clients\n\nCreate a custom audience from your email list or website visitors. These people already know you and are much more likely to book.\n\n## 5. No Clear Offer\n\nEvery ad needs a compelling reason to book NOW. Whether it's a discount, limited-time offer, or exclusive treatment, give people a reason to act immediately.\n\n## 6. Wrong Budget Distribution\n\nDon't spread your budget too thin across multiple ad sets. Start with £10-15 per day on one well-targeted ad set, then scale what works.\n\n## 7. Not Testing Different Creatives\n\nAlways test at least 3 different images or videos per ad set. What works for one salon might not work for another.\n\n## Ready to Get It Right?\n\nIf you're tired of wasting money on ads that don't work, we can help. Our custom Instagram ads are specifically designed for beauty and wellness businesses in London.\n\n[Get your free checklist here](/)"

    "content": "One of the most common questions we get from salon owners is: 'How much should I be spending on marketing?' The answer depends on several factors...\n\n## General Rule: 7-10% of Revenue\n\nMost successful salons invest 7-10% of their monthly revenue back into marketing. For a salon making £10,000/month, that's £700-1,000 for marketing.\n\n## Budget Breakdown by Salon Size\n\n### Small Salon (1-2 chairs, £5k-10k/month)\n- Total marketing budget: £350-700/month\n- Instagram/Facebook ads: 40% (£140-280)\n- Google Ads: 30% (£105-210)\n- Social media content: 20% (£70-140)\n- Print/local advertising: 10% (£35-70)\n\n### Medium Salon (3-5 chairs, £15k-25k/month)\n- Total marketing budget: £1,050-1,750/month\n- Instagram/Facebook ads: 45% (£470-790)\n- Google Ads: 25% (£260-440)\n- Social media content: 20% (£210-350)\n- Events/partnerships: 10% (£105-175)\n\n### Large Salon (6+ chairs, £30k+/month)\n- Total marketing budget: £2,100+/month\n- Instagram/Facebook ads: 35% (£735+)\n- Google Ads: 25% (£525+)\n- Social media content: 20% (£420+)\n- PR/influencer partnerships: 15% (£315+)\n- Events/community: 5% (£105+)\n\n## Where to Start If You're New to Marketing\n\n1. **Month 1-2**: Focus on organic social media and Google My Business\n2. **Month 3-4**: Add small Instagram ad budget (£10-15/day)\n3. **Month 5-6**: Expand to Google Ads if Instagram is working\n4. **Month 7+**: Test additional channels\n\n## Red Flags: When You're Spending Too Much\n\n- Customer acquisition cost exceeds 30% of lifetime value\n- You're spending on multiple channels without tracking results\n- Marketing budget is cutting into operational expenses\n- No clear ROI tracking system in place\n\n## Red Flags: When You're Spending Too Little\n\n- Less than 5% of revenue on marketing\n- Relying solely on word-of-mouth\n- No new client acquisition strategy\n- Inconsistent marketing efforts\n\n## Measuring Success: Key Metrics to Track\n\n- **Cost per lead**: How much you pay for each potential client inquiry\n- **Conversion rate**: What percentage of leads become paying clients\n- **Customer lifetime value**: Average revenue per client over their lifetime\n- **Return on ad spend (ROAS)**: Revenue generated per pound spent on ads\n\n## Quick Win: Start with £300/month\n\nIf you're not marketing at all, start with £300/month:\n- £150 for Instagram/Facebook ads\n- £100 for professional content creation\n- £50 for Google My Business optimization\n\n## Need Help Planning Your Marketing Budget?\n\nWe help salon owners create marketing strategies that actually generate bookings.
